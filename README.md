# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./Project%20Requirements/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## 🌍 Overview

This little component is a beginner project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H/hub). I wanted to build this project to stay connected to my CSS skills.

As with any skill, if you don't use it, you lose it. 😫 So this little build is a part of my ongoing professional development.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Dependencies

This component was built with HTML and vanilla CSS. No dependencies! 🥳
I also used [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) and the [Eye Dropper/Color Picker](https://eyedropper.org/) browser extensions to help with the build.

I deployed the component with Netlify, though, so check that out [here](https://visionary-croquembouche-31b073.netlify.app/).

## 🤔 Reflection

My experience with this build was a nice introduction to using Frontend Mentor. It was also a good refresher for super basic CSS concepts like how to center a div. 🫠

With this project, I used [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) for the first time. I wanted to try to use it to recreate the QR Code component as closely as I could to the original images. Since I just had images as references, as opposed to a Figma file or something, PerfectPixel was a nice tool to use.

## 👀 Demo & Live Version

Do you want to see this little, baby component out in the wild? Well, sadly, it just lives all by itself in its own personal repo. But! You can check out [the deployed version here](https://visionary-croquembouche-31b073.netlify.app/).
